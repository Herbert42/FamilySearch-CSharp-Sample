# FamilySearch-CSharp-Sample
The purpose of this project is to show the same functionality as the FamilySearch JavaScript SDK Sample App, but as a C# project in Visual Studio 2015. The FamilySearch JavaScript SDK Sample App can be found here: https://fs-javascript-sdk-sample-app.herokuapp.com/ 
This project is in active development and by no means ready to show off at this point. It is however use-able right now, it compiles and shows some functionality.

###What you need:
>- Visual Studio 2015
>- Developers account from FamilySearch.org (free)
>- App-key for desktop applications

You will not need to type in your App-Key in a real world application, it would be in you code. I just want to protect my own key.
Have a look at https://familysearch.org/Developer/ to get started and read through https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/authentication/Access_Token_resource concerning the **Password grant type**.

At this point the following forms are functional and in a presentable state:
 >- Authenticate
 >- Find Person by Id
 >- Current User
 >- Read Person's Family
 >- Person Search
 >- Read Person's Ancestry
